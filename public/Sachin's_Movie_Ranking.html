<h1>My favorite Movies</h1> 
<h2>Top 3 movies according to Sachin.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Avengers: Endgame</h3>
<p>I like this one because of all the characters that were previously built up in their own movies 
    and how this was the culmination of the entire mcu up to that point.</p>
<h3>2. Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>I like this movie because it was really funny and even though Forrest seems like he can't do 
    anything right, ha actually has a bunch of strengths which he plays to become successful.</p>
<h3>3. Ratatouille</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorite animated movies because of how unexpected the whole plot is and how 
    lovable Remy is as a character</p>
